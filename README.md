Module12_NoSQL Challenge
This challenge is in 2 parts - setting up the databse, updating and then analyzing the data.
There was assistance from the team at AskBCS as there were challenges with the longitude/latitude of the new restaurant added (that information was not provided in the exercise, which made finding other establishments near it difficult), as well as with the pipeline.
